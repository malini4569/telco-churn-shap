# Interpretable Machine Learning for Credit Risk Prediction  
### Using XGBoost + SHAP on the Customer Churn Dataset

This project builds and interprets a customer churn prediction model using  
the **Credit Risk and Finance Risk.csv** dataset.  
The model is trained with **XGBoost** inside a complete scikit-learn Pipeline  
and interpreted using **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** to produce  
both global and local explanations.

## 📌 Project Objectives

1. Build a high-quality churn prediction model using advanced ML techniques  
   (XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning).
2. Apply **SHAP interpretability** to extract:
   - Global feature importance  
   - Local explanations for specific customers (waterfall + force plots)
3. Generate business insights and actionable retention recommendations.
4. Provide a transparent, reproducible pipeline for model training, evaluation,  
   and SHAP analysis.
